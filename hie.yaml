# A library inside haskell-language-server called **hie-bios** is responsible
# for helping your IDE (ie Visual Studio Code) set up a GHCi session such that
# Haskell code can be analyzed and typechecked. This file _hie.yaml_
# configures hie-bios.
#
# Your IDE has to figure out which component of the Haskell package you are in
# is the one that the file you are editing is a part of. A common guess is
# "the first executable listed" but this is a poor choice as things like test
# suites often have considerable additional dependencies and your IDE will
# report "package not found" errors. A quick workaround is to compile
# everything as if it were in your test suite, as shown below.
#
# For anything more complicated, you can try:
#
# $ stack install implicit-hie
# $ gen-hie > hie.yaml
#
# to create a suitable _hie.yaml_ stub you can then edit. But as
# haskell-language-server gets more sophisticated, the need for a file like
# this will diminish.
